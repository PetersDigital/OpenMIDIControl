## Implementation Roadmap

Following the [Version Roadmap](README.md#version-roadmap-v0.1.0-to-v1.0.0), the implementation is structured as follows:

### ✅ v0.1.0: Baseline
- **Responsive UI Shell:** Building the "Ethereal Console" using `LayoutBuilder` (Portrait Phone / Landscape Tablet).
- **Core Fader Logic:** Multi-touch pointer capture and normalized `0.0..1.0` value domain.
- **State Management:** Riverpod `Notifier` providers for transport-agnostic logic.

### ✅ v0.1.5: MIDI Reliability & Logic Polish
- **Metadata Reconnection:** Switched from transient IDs to Name/Manufacturer fingerprints for robust USB hot-plugging.
- **Virtual MIDI Bridge:** Native `VirtualMidiService.kt` to expose "OpenMIDIControl" as a device for other mobile apps.
- **Bi-directional Logic Engine:** Behavior logic (Catch-up/Hybrid) applied to both UI drag events and incoming MIDI `CC` streams.
- **Orientation Fix:** Dedicated `_MobileLandscapeLayout` to handle ultra-wide aspect ratios (19.5:9+).
- **Active Port UI:** Translucent row highlighting in MIDI settings to visualize active "data pipes."

### ✅ v0.2.0: Advanced USB MIDI & Dual-Path Routing
- **True Peripheral Mode:** Native Android `MidiDeviceService` for class compliance on Windows 11.
- **Dual-Path Routing:** High-speed native Kotlin transport for peripheral mode bypassing Flutter event loop.
- **Performance Batching:** 8ms Coroutine-based buffering for smooth UI fader rendering.
- **Binder Stability:** Port collision hiding and "Dead Receiver Quarantine" logic to prevent Binder crashes during hotplugging.
- **Thread Safety:** Migrated state maps to `ConcurrentHashMap` for cross-thread reliability.
- **Manual Port Selection:** Added a toggle in Settings to optionally show internal ports in the device list.

### ⏳ Current Focus: v0.3.0 (Control Expansion)
- **Grid Components:** Implementing a 3×3 pad grid with low-latency velocity simulation.
- **Tactile Feedback:** Expanding haptic patterns for button toggles and multi-state switches.

### ⏳ v0.4.0+: MCU, HUI & Desktop Bridge
- **High Res (14-bit):** Pitch Bend and MSB/LSB pair handling for high-resolution DAW control.
- **Wireless Transport:** Optional rtpMIDI and WebSocket bridges for advanced macro integration.
- **MCU/HUI Handshake:** Native support for industry-standard DAW feedback protocols.
